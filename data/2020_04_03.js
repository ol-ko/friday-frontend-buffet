        This course will introduce you to accessibility through hands-on,
        technical examples that are way more effective than reading 10-year-old
        static web content.

        In this course you’ll get hands-on experience making web applications
        accessible. You’ll understand when and why users need accessibility.
        Then you’ll dive into the 'how': making a page work properly with screen
        readers, and managing input focus (e.g. the highlight you see when
        tabbing through a form.) You’ll understand what 'semantics' and
        'semantic markup' mean for web pages and add ARIA markup to enable
        navigating the interface with a range of assistive devices. Finally,
        you’ll learn styling techniques that help users with partial vision
        navigate your pages easily and reliably.
